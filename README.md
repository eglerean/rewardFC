# Functional connectivity for "Reward PET" study

Analysis is divided into steps.

## Step 0 - from SPM preprocessed data to NIFTI 4D files

Run BASH script step0_merge.sh. This script also takes care of copying motion parameters that will be used at step 1.

## Step 1 - further preprocessing for connectivity
